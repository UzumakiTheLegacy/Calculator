# Calculator.js
This is a calculator which can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square, squareroot, lcm and hcf
Note : This can only do addition, subtraction, multiplicatiom, division, lcm and hcf of 2 numbers. I am going to update it soon then it will be able to do addition, subtraction, multiplicatiom, division, lcm and hcf of many numbers(atleast more than 2 XD)
Also Note: Dont add text or something when it asks number otherwise it will give NaN or undefined. I will update that too soon. <3
Also I will add a input box and stuffs later on 
i dont know what else to write 
Thank you <3
